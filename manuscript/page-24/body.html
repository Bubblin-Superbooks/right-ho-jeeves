<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>I threw my mind back to the last time I had seen him. About two years ago, it had been. I had looked in at his place while on a motor trip, and he had put me right off my feed by bringing a couple of green things with legs to the luncheon table, crooning over them like a young mother and eventually losing one of them in the salad. That picture, rising before my eyes, didn't give me much confidence in the unfortunate goof's ability to woo and win, I must say. Especially if the girl he had earmarked was one of these tough modern thugs, all lipstick and cool, hard, sardonic eyes, as she probably was.</p><p>"Tell me, Jeeves," I said, wishing to know the worst, "what sort of a girl is this girl of Gussie's?"</p><p>"I have not met the young lady, sir. Mr. Fink-Nottle speaks highly of her attractions."</p><p>"Seemed to like her, did he?"</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p></div> </div>
